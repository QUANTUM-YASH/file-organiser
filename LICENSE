## **4️⃣ Steps to Upload to GitHub**

1. **Create a GitHub repository** called `file_organizer`  
   - Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)  
   - Give it a name, optional description, no README (we will add ours)

2. **Initialize Git locally** in your project folder:

```bash
cd D:\projects\file_organiser
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: File Organizer project"
